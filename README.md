The idea for my assignment is that I would have a robot dog with an arm
attached to it that it can use to water plants.

The player can send commands to the dog with the mouse to guide it to the plants
so the dog will feature some pathfinding

The plants will wither over time if not watered in time so this introduces a
semblence of a game feedback loop. The idea is to keep the plants alive.

The setting is taking place in a fallout setting with our robot dog friend
having nothing to do but water plants after everyone has left.
